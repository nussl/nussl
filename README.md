**NUSSL IS DEPRECATED** <br />
There will be no further any updates, bug fixes, or answers for open issues. We're leaving the code here as is for reference and educational purposes.


nussl (pronounced ["nuzzle"](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nuzzle)) is a flexible, object oriented
Python audio source separation library created by the 
[Interactive Audio Lab](http://music.cs.northwestern.edu/) 
at Northwestern University. It stands for Northwestern University Source Separation Library (or our less-branded backronym: 
"Need Unmixing? Source Separation Library!"). Whether you're a researcher creating novel network architectures or new signal 
processing approaches for source separation or you just need an out-of-the-box source separation model, nussl contains 
everything you need for modern source separation, from prototyping to evaluation to end-use.


# Documentation

Tutorials, code examples, and the API reference are available at the documentation
website which is [available here.](https://nussl.github.io/docs/)


# Features


## Deep Learning

nussl contains a rich feature set for deep learning models, including a 
built in trainer with support for many common datasets in music and speech separation.
nussl also has a External File Zoo where users are able to download pre-trained
models on many different datasets with a number of different configurations. 

### Training Your Own Algorithms

nussl makes it easy to train your own algorithms, with many common architectures,
datasets, and configurations ready-built for many use cases, and an easy way to
extend our built-in functionality for your own needs. There are many pre-built useful
modules that are easy to piece together, such as LSTMs, GRUs, convolutional layers,
fully conneected layers, mask layers, embedding layers. Everything is built on PyTorch, so adding a brand new module is a snap!

### Using Your Own Data

nussl has existing support for many popular source separation datasets, like MUSDB18,
WSJ0, WHAM!, and FUSS. nussl also defines a simple directory structure to add in any data you want.
Want to augment your data? We have support for datasets created with [Scaper](https://scaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) built in so you
can train on magnitudes more training data. 

### Downloading Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models on speech separation, music separation, and more are available
for download at the [External File Zoo (EFZ)](http://nussl.ci.northwestern.edu/),
and there is a built in python API to download models you want from within your code.

## Deep Learning Architectures

We provide the following architectures available out of the box:
* Mask Inference
* Deep Clustering
* Chimera
* OpenUnmix (Soon!)
* TasNet (Soon!)
* DualPath RNN (Soon!)

(See docs for corresponding citations)

## Classical Algorithms

Additionally, nussl also contains implementations of many classical source separation
algorithms, including:

* Spatialization algorithms: DUET, PROJET
* Factorization-based Methods: RPCA, ICA
* Primitive Methods: Repetition (REPET, 2DFT), Harmonic/Percussive, Vocal melody extraction, Timbre clustering
* Benchmark Methods: High Pass filter, Binary Masks, Ratio Masks, Weiner Filtering

## Interaction

nussl supports light interaction via [gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).
To launch a web interface where you can upload audio and hear
separations, simply do:

```python
import nussl

# Make a dummy signal to instantiate object.
dummy_signal = nussl.AudioSignal()

# Create some separation object with desired config.
# This will use the 2DFT algorithm, but since interaction
# is implemented in the base separation object, it is
# available to every algorithm.
ft2d = nussl.separation.primitive.FT2D(dummy_signal)

# Launch the Gradio interface. Use `share=True` to make
# a public link that you can share! Warning - people with
# access to the link will be running code on YOUR
# machine.
ft2d.interact()
```

Or all at once, using `share=True` to create a public link that you can
give to others.

```bash
>>> import nussl
>>> nussl.separation.primitive.HPSS(nussl.AudioSignal()).interact(share=True)
Running locally at: http://127.0.0.1:7860/
This share link will expire in 6 hours. If you need a permanent link, email support@gradio.app
Running on External URL: https://22218.gradio.app
```

This will launch an interface that looks like this:

## Evaluation

nussl has many built in evaluation measures to determine how well your algorithm did, including
the museval measure (BSSEvalV4), SI-SDR, SI-SIR, SI-SAR, SD-SDR, SNR, and more! We seek to 
provide a thorough framework for evaluating your source separation research.

# Installation


nussl is on the Python Package Index (PyPI), so it is easy to install with pip:

```
$ pip install nussl
```

**Note: Requires python 3.7+**

For the functionality in ``nussl.play_utils``, you'll want IPython, and ``ffmpeg``, installed as well:

```
$ pip install IPython
$ brew install ffmpeg # on mac
$ apt-get install ffmpeg # on linux
```

To use the Melodia separation algorithm, you'll need to specify this:

```
$ pip install "nussl[melodia]"
```

`vamp` doesn't install on some MacOS versions, so we can't include it by default.
To actually use Melodia, you'll also need the Melodia plugin. For installation
instructions, look [here](https://github.com/justinsalamon/melodia_python_tutorial/blob/master/melodia_python_tutorial.ipynb).


Augmentation effects are applied via either PySox or SoxBindings, if on Linux or MacOS.
`soxbindings` can't be installed from PyPI on Windows, but it may be installable from source.
For source installation instructions, look [here](https://github.com/pseeth/soxbindings). Other
augmentation effects are applied via FFMpeg.

# Citing

If you are using nussl for your research project, we please ask that you cite it using one of the 
following bibtex citations:

    @inproceedings {nussl
        author = {Ethan Manilow and Prem Seetharaman and Bryan Pardo},
        title = "The Northwestern University Source Separation Library",
        publisher = "Proceedings of the 19th International Society of Music Information Retrieval 
            Conference ({ISMIR} 2018), Paris, France, September 23-27",
        year = 2018
    }


# Issues and Contributions

See the [contribution guide](https://nussl.github.io/docs/contributing.html) for
detailed information. But the basics are: bug fixes/enhancements/etc have the standard github
process; but, when adding new algorithms, contributors must provide benchmark files, paper 
references, and trained models (if applicable). Please see the issues page before contacting the authors.
