Changelog
=========
v1.1.5
------
- Added load function to SeparationModel.
- Allow keyword arguments to pass transparently through a SeparationModel.
- Added runtime arguments to DeepMixin, and a callback that can be implemented by a user
  to modify an input data dictionary before it's passed to a SeparationModel.
- Added an OverlapAdd algorithm that can be used with any separation object.
- Adding argument to MelProjection so that it matches librosa mel filters.

v1.1.4
------
- Fixed visualization of mel spectrogram.

v1.1.3
------
- Fixed some bugs that happen because of a PyTorch Ignite update.
- Fixed a bug in effects where the sample rate wouldn't propagate through some effects.
- Added more metadata that can be saved along with a model, using an associate_metrics function.
- Updated handlers for printing after each epoch during training and writing to tensorboard.
- Added interaction via gradio.

v1.1.2
------
- Fixed a bug in Dual Path models where they couldn't be used with DataParallel.
