Using REPET
===========

*nussl* contains many source separation algorithms. Here will demonstrate how to use *nussl* to run REPET. The basic
principles outlined here work across all of the source separation algorithms in *nussl*.

Introduction
------------

The REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique, or REPET, is source separation algorithm that separates a repeating
"background" from a non-repeating "foreground". REPET finds the repeating period in an audio signal, slices the signal
into "frames" of the same length of the repeating period and "overlays" those frames. Once the frames are overlayed,
REPET extracts the non-repeating part by filtering out values that are far from the median value at each frame.

In order to run REPET in *nussl*, we first must create an ``AudioSignal`` object. We're going to load a file as before.

>>> import nussl
>>> history = nussl.AudioSignal('HistoryRepeatingPropellerHeads.wav')

Neat. Now, we need to instantiate a ``Repet`` object. **Like all source separation algorithms** in *nussl*, ``Repet``
needs an ``AudioSignal`` object as its first parameter when we initialize it.

>>> repet = nussl.Repet(history)

Again, **like all other algorithms in** *nussl*, ``Repet`` **has made its own copy of our** ``history`` object that it
will manipulate, so we can reuse ``history`` again if we want to.

Repeating Period
----------------

If we know exactly what the repeating period is, we can give that ``Repet`` or if we kind of know where it is we can
give it some estimates. Say I think the repeating period is about 3.5 seconds.

>>> repet_exact_period = nussl.Repet(history, period=3.5)  # exact period
>>> repet_period_guess = nussl.Repet(history, min_period=3.4, max_period=3.6)  # guess the period

But! If we have no clue, then ``Repet`` will try to find the repeating period for us, automatically. So we're back to
this:

>>> repet = nussl.Repet(history)

Running Repet
-------------

Now, we can run the algorithm, and **all nussl algorithms**, in one of two ways:

>>> repet.run()
>>> repet()

Both do the same thing. Now Repet has been run (twice). We can check out properties of ``Repet``.

>>> repet.repeating_period  # gets repeating period in integer multiples of hop (stft time bins)
88
>>> repet.beat_spectrum  # this is a 1-D np array representing beat strength
array([  9.64896795e+04,   4.99998429e+04,   3.75931435e+04,
         3.38020910e+04,   3.17312478e+04,   3.03712653e+04,
         2.92616252e+04,   3.05355762e+04,   4.01459695e+04,
         ...
         7.48095401e+02,   6.56239875e+02,   5.53445200e+02,
         9.16959708e+02,   1.63284254e+03,   6.62180164e+03,
         4.62078346e+03,   3.22329084e+02,   1.38383443e+00])

If we hadn't run ``Repet`` we could still get the beat spectrum. We can also compute a beat spectrum of an
arbitrary 2-D real valued matrix (as a np.array)

>>> repet2 = nussl.Repet(histoy)
>>> history_beat_spectrum = repet2.get_beat_spectrum()
>>> random_beat_spectrum = repet2.compute_beat_spectrum(np.random.uniform(size=(1025, 100)))

Getting the results
-------------------

Okay, okay, okay. Now that we've run ``Repet`` let's get the results and output them to a file. We get results from
all of our algorithms in *nussl* the same way, by calling ``make_audio_signals()``:

>>> background, foreground = repet.make_audio_signals()
>>> type(background), type(foreground)
nussl.audio_signal.AudioSignal, nussl.audio_signal.AudioSignal

We can see that ``make_audio_signals()`` produces two new ``AudioSignal`` objects. Why two? One for each source. Other
algorithms (like DUET) may produce different numbers of ``AudioSignal`` objects.

Now, we can use these just like before. So let's write our results to files:

>>> background.write_audio_to_file('history_background.wav')
>>> foreground.write_audio_to_file('history_foreground.wav')

Tying it all together
---------------------

Here's what the basics of ``Repet`` look like all at once:

>>> history = nussl.AudioSignal('HistoryRepeatingPropellerHeads.wav')
>>> repet = nussl.Repet(history)
>>> repet()
>>> background, foreground = repet.make_audio_signals()
>>> background.write_audio_to_file('history_background.wav')
>>> foreground.write_audio_to_file('history_foreground.wav')

`That's pretty neat! <https://youtu.be/OXZt4-LTtHw>`_
